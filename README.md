## Introduction

**DDS Ecommerce** is a web application that enables users to find a suitable product for themselves or their acquaintances and make online orders at a time convenient for them. For a better user experience, the products are filtered by category and price. Ð¢here is an option to search for products by name. And because user opinion is important to us, we provide the opportunity to comment on the products and vote a ratings, which facilitates the choice compared to other users. It supports three types of user: Guest, User and Admin. Guests can browse the products and see the reviews left by users. Registered users have the opportunity to leave a review for a product, give their rating, purchase the products they have ordered, as well as view their orders.
